# hello-world
Git Hub test 
My name is BC Goodnick, I am completely new to this, I am a little nervous as I am embarking on a new area of learning and do not like being bad at things. I believe this process will enable me to learn new skillsets and potentially learn how to work around data and analytics and potentially learn to code as well. They say learning enw languages is good for your brain, today I learn to speak computer.
